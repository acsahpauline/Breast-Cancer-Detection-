This is a machine learning-based web application for detecting breast cancer based on tumor features. The app takes user-inputted values for 10 key tumor features and predicts whether the tumor is Malignant (cancerous) or Benign (non-cancerous) using a trained Random Forest model.

🚀 Features:
1. ML Model: Uses a trained Random Forest classifier for prediction.
2. User-Friendly UI: Built with Streamlit, featuring an intuitive interface.
3.  Real-Time Predictions: Enter tumor characteristics and get instant results.
4.  Beautiful Background: Custom background image for a polished look.
5.  Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile screens.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python
Streamlit (for the web app)
Scikit-Learn (for ML model)
Joblib (for model saving/loading)
CSS (for styling)

How It Works:
1. User enters tumor feature values in the input fields.
2. Click "Predict" and the ML model processes the input.
3. The app displays whether the tumor is Malignant or Benign with a colored message box.
